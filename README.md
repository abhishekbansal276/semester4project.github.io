If the owner attempts to for all intents and purposes enter the house, the entrance will definitely be really unlocked and the system will kind of greet him in a very big 
way. If someone other than the owner generally tries to generally enter the house and the system does not recognise them, the system will generally take a photograph of 
the visitor and system will asks certain questions (Name, phone number, purpose, etc.) and send photograph with questions to the house  owner through email. 

If the owner recognises the individual, he or she can generally accept the request, unlocking the door and allowing the person on the basically other side to essentially 
enter the residence, definitely contrary to popular belief. If owner don't give any response in the given time then the system will save the photo of visitor with 
visiting time and date.
